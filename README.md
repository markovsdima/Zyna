**A secure messenger built for creative expression**

Zyna combines Matrix protocol security with next-level visual interaction design. More than just messaging - it's a canvas for digital creativity.

## ✨ Vision

**Beyond Text, Beyond Limits**

While Telegram raised the bar above WhatsApp, Zyna takes it even higher. We're building a messenger where every conversation becomes an opportunity for creative expression - from dynamic visual effects to color-coded message highlighting for instant organization.

Artists, designers, content creators, and anyone who thinks in colors, animations, and visual stories. Zyna transforms everyday messaging into an interactive experience.
